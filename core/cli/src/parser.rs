//! Command line argument parsing for the Inference compiler.
//!
//! This module defines the CLI interface using `clap`. The `Cli` struct captures
//! all command line flags and arguments passed to the `infc` binary.
//!
//! For comprehensive usage documentation, see `README.md` in this crate.

use clap::Parser;

/// Command line interface definition for the Inference compiler.
///
/// The `infc` compiler operates in phases, and users must explicitly request
/// which phases to run via command line flags. Phases execute in canonical order
/// (parse → analyze → codegen) regardless of flag order.
///
/// ## Phase Dependencies
///
/// - `--parse`: Standalone, builds the typed AST
/// - `--analyze`: Requires parsing (automatically runs parse phase)
/// - `--codegen`: Requires analysis (automatically runs parse and analyze phases)
///
/// ## Output Flags
///
/// - `-o`: Generate WASM binary file in `out/` directory
/// - `-v`: Generate Rocq (.v) translation in `out/` directory
///
/// Output flags only take effect when `--codegen` is specified.
///
/// ## Examples
///
/// Parse only:
/// ```bash
/// infc example.inf --parse
/// ```
///
/// Full compilation with WASM output:
/// ```bash
/// infc example.inf --codegen -o
/// ```
///
/// Full compilation with Rocq translation:
/// ```bash
/// infc example.inf --codegen -o -v
/// ```
